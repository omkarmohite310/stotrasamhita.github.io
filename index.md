[Stōtrasaṃhitā](http://stotrasamhita.net/) is a wiki of stotrams and namavalis, displayed in many Indian scripts. The great rishis and saints of bhāratadēśam have left us a treasure trove of excellent stotras. There have been many wonderful books publishing these, such as the mantrapuṣpam (from Sri Ramakrisha Mutt) and bṛhatstōtraratnākaram, to name a few.  A vast majority of these stotras are in saṃskṛtam, and one needs to be able to read dēvanāgarī lipi, to be able to recite these stotras. However, with a multitude of languages and scripts in our country, many people are more comfortable with their own mother tongue. [Stōtrasaṃhitā](http://stotrasamhita.net/) seeks to bridge this gap, by rendering these languages in multiple lipis, 
thanks to [Translipi](http://srican.blogspot.in/2007/02/introducing-trans-lipi.html).

In this GitHub repository, we hope to make available high-quality PDFs for printing as well as devices such as Kindle, along with tools to proofread (long-term goal!). Perhaps, it may well be possible to integrate `stotrasamhita.net` with this `github.io` page. This repository is also home to various <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.

### Major Books

#### Stotra Sangrahah

This is a massive book containing (nearly) all the stotras on the StotraSamhita website. It can be printed out in A5 format (with mirror margins, "A5-print") or for reading on 8" tablets (A5). There is also a Kindle version of the PDF, which works perfect on 6" devices such as the Kindle Paperwhite (highly recommended!).
